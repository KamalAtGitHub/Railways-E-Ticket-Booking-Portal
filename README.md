### **Description of the Railway Management System Python Code**

This Python script is a **Railway Management System** that allows users to create accounts, log in, book train tickets, check ticket status, cancel tickets, and manage their accounts. It uses **MySQL** as the database for storing user accounts and ticket details.

## **Key Features of the Code**

### **1. Database Connection Setup**
- The script prompts the user to enter MySQL **hostname, username, and password**.
- Establishes a connection to the MySQL database using `mysql.connector`.
- Enables **autocommit mode** to execute queries automatically.

### **2. Database & Table Creation**
- The database **"IRCTC"** is created if it doesnâ€™t exist.
- Two tables are created:
  - **`accounts`**: Stores user account details (ID, password, name, gender, age, DOB, phone number).
  - **`tickets`**: Stores ticket details (ID, PNR, train name, journey date, departure station, destination).

### **Login (`login`)**
- Asks for **User ID** and **password**.
